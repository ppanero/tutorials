# React Tutorials
Repository with the code of some tutorials I have followed to learn React.

- ReactJS: Code for the ``Tic-Tac-Toe`` game developed by following the [reactjs.org tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).
- Modern React with Redux: Code produced in the Udemy Course [Modern React with Redux \[2019 Update\]](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/).
